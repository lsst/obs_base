Optimized ingest raws to support summit operations.

* Now report timing information on ingest completion including separating out butler timings from metadata extraction.
* Added a new callback that is called whenever a dimension record is created.
* Changed defineVisits to allow it to be called with dimension records in addition to data coordinates.
* Switched from `multiprocessing.Pool` to `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`, resulting in significant speed ups for large numbers of files.
* Added ability to declare that there are no per-directory index files.
* Changed how sidecar files are read to prevent an unnecessary round trip to remote object stores if the file does exist.
