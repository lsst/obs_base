When defining visits, always update visit-detector regions if `update_records=True`.

Previously, we only updated visit-detector regions when the visit record itself changed, which made it impossible to fix cases where the code for the detector regions was changing but the visit record was not, as well as more mysterious cases where some visit-detector regions were not originally inserted at all.
