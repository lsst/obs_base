            The default is to search for FITS files. The regex applies to
            files within the directory.
        group_files : `bool`, optional
            Group files by directory if they have been discovered in
            directories. Will not affect files explicitly provided.
        skip_existing_exposures : `bool`, optional

            Control whether file attributes such as the size or checksum should

        Notes
        -----
        This method inserts all datasets for an exposure within a transaction,
        guaranteeing that partial exposures are never ingested.  The exposure
        dimension record is inserted with `Registry.syncDimensionData` first
        (in its own transaction), which inserts only if a record with the same
        primary key does not already exist.  This allows different files within
        the same exposure to be ingested in different runs.
