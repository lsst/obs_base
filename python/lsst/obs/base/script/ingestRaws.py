    """Ingest raw frames into the butler registry.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repo : `str`
        URI to the repository.
    locations : `list` [`str`]
        Files to ingest and directories to search for files that match
        ``regex`` to ingest.
    regex : `str`
        Regex string used to find files in directories listed in locations.
    output_run : `str`
        The path to the location, the run, where datasets should be put.
    fail_fast : `bool`
        If True, stop ingest as soon as any problem is encountered with any
        file. Otherwise problem files will be skipped and logged and a report
        issued at completion.
    config : `dict` [`str`, `str`] or `None`
        Key-value pairs to apply as overrides to the ingest config.
    config_file : `str` or `None`
        Path to a config file that contains overrides to the ingest config.
    transfer : `str` or None
        The external data transfer type, by default "auto".
    processes : `int`
        Number of processes to use for ingest.
    ingest_task : `str`
        The fully qualified class name of the ingest task to use by default
        lsst.obs.base.RawIngestTask.
    track_file_attrs : `bool`, optional
        Control whether file attributes such as the size or checksum should
        be tracked by the datastore. Whether this parameter is honored
        depends on the specific datastore implementation.
    update_records : `bool`, optional
        Control whether recalculated exposure definitions will be accepted or
        not.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        Raised if operations on configuration object fail.
