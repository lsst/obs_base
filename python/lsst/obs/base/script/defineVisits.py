    """Implements the command line interface `butler define-visits` subcommand,
    should only be called by command line tools and unit test code that tests
    this function.

    Defines visits from exposures in the butler registry

    Parameters
    ----------
    repo : `str`
        URI to the location to create the repo.
    config_file : `str` or `None`
        Path to a config file that contains overrides to the ingest config.
    collections : `list` [`str`]
        An expression specifying the collections to be searched (in order) when
        reading datasets, and optionally dataset type restrictions on them.
        If empty it will be passed as `None` to Butler.
    instrument : `str`
        The name or fully-qualified class name of an instrument.
    where : `str`, optional
        Query clause to use when querying for dataIds. Can be used to limit
        the relevant exposures.
    raw_name : `str`, optional
        Name of the raw dataset type name.  Defaults to 'raw'.

    Notes
    -----
    Camera geometry is not currently found in registry but instead a default
    camera will be used for the relevant instrument.
