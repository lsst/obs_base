    Notes
    -----
    The intention is for each obs package to have a single test class that
    inherits from this collector class, thus "automatically" getting all new
    tests. If those tests require setup that isn't defined in a given obs
    package, that obs package will be broken until updated. This is
    intentional, as a way to prevent obs packages from falling behind out of
    neglect.
