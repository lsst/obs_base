    Parameters
    ----------
    path : `tuple` [`str`]
        This tuple contains the top level of the data tree at index=0,
        and then further optional subdirectories in subsequent
        indices.  See Notes below for more details.
    chip_id : `int` or None
        The identifier for the sensor in question.  To be used in
        validation.
    filter_name : `str` or None
        The identifier for the filter in question.  To be used in
        validation.
    calib_class : `Any`
        The class to use to read the curated calibration text file. Must
        support the ``readText()`` method.

    Returns
    -------
    data_dict : `dict`
        A dictionary of calibration objects constructed from the
        appropriate factory class.  The key is the validity start time
        as a `datetime.datetime` object.
    calib_type : `str`
        The type of calibrations that have been read and are included
        in the ``data_dict``.

    Notes
    -----
    Curated calibrations are read from the appropriate ``obs_ _data``
    package, and are required to have a common directory structure to
    be identified and ingested properly.  The top-level directories
    are organized by the instrument's ``policyName``.  These names are
    generally all lower-case, but this is not universally true.

    Below the top-level instrument directory, subdirectories named
    after the curated calibration type contained within, with the
    dataset_type_name forced to lowercase.  For calibrations that
    depend on the detector (i.e., the defects), the next level of
    subdirectories should contain directories named with the detector
    name, again forced to lowercase.

    For filter dependent calibrations that do not depend on the
    detector (i.e., transmission_filter), the calibrations should be
    grouped into directories named with the physical filter name
    (again, all lowercase) below the dataset_type_name directory.
    Filter dependent calibrations that do depend on the detector
    (i.e., transmission_system), have physical filter named
    directories below the detector level directories.
